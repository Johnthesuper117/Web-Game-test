# Web-Game-test
I test Web games here 

Plan: 
Core Design and Development Focus
Retro Movement Mechanics
Strafing and Rocket Jumping: Implement classic FPS mechanics such as bunny hopping, strafing, and rocket jumping. These mechanics should be physics-based but simplified to mimic the retro feel.
Simplified Physics: Use a fixed physics timestep to ensure consistent movement behavior across different hardware. Include settings to tweak gravity, friction, and acceleration for easy customization.
Fast-Paced Gameplay: Optimize for responsive controls and low input latency. Provide configuration options for mouse sensitivity, field of view (FOV), and crosshair customization.
2. Modular Architecture
Component-Based Design: Break down the engine into reusable and replaceable components such as rendering, input, physics, and audio systems.
Plugin System: Allow developers to add or replace modules, such as swapping out the physics engine or using a custom renderer.
Data-Driven Systems: Employ data-driven design for game logic and settings. Use JSON, XML, or other easily editable formats for configuration.
3. Optimization Techniques
Level of Detail (LOD): Implement automatic or manual LOD systems to adjust the complexity of objects based on their distance from the player.
Occlusion Culling: Optimize rendering by skipping objects that are not visible to the player.
Multithreading: Leverage multithreading for tasks like physics calculations, AI processing, and asset streaming.
Memory Management: Implement efficient memory allocation and garbage collection systems to reduce overhead.
Developer-Centric Features
1. Scripting and Customization
Scripting Language Support: Integrate a lightweight scripting language like Lua or Python for gameplay logic. Provide APIs to access engine components.
Hot Reloading: Support hot reloading of scripts and assets to minimize iteration time during development.
Gameplay Tweaks: Allow developers to tweak gameplay mechanics, such as movement speed and weapon behavior, via scripts or configuration files.
2. Tools and Interfaces
Level Editor: Create an intuitive level editor with drag-and-drop support for assets, terrain editing, and pathfinding nodes.
Modding Support: Provide tools for creating and packaging mods. Include documentation and examples to guide modders.
Debugging Tools: Include in-engine debugging tools for profiling performance, visualizing physics, and tracking memory usage.
3. Resource Efficiency
Cross-Platform Support: Optimize the engine to run efficiently on both modern and older hardware for wide accessibility.
Asset Compression: Use efficient file formats and compression techniques for textures, audio, and models.
Dynamic Scaling: Allow dynamic scaling of resolution and effects to adapt to different hardware capabilities.
Community and Documentation
1. Open Source Contribution
Host the engine on GitHub to attract contributors. Use a permissive license like MIT or Apache to encourage community involvement.
Provide a clear contribution guide, issue templates, and a code of conduct.
2. Documentation and Tutorials
Developer Documentation: Offer comprehensive documentation covering engine architecture, APIs, and customization options.
Tutorials: Include step-by-step guides for creating levels, scripting gameplay, and adding new features.
Community Forums: Set up a forum or Discord channel for developers and modders to collaborate and share knowledge.
3. Showcase Examples
Include example projects and templates to demonstrate the engineâ€™s capabilities.
Provide a demo game to showcase retro FPS mechanics and inspire developers.
Testing and Feedback
1. User Feedback
Conduct beta testing with developers and modders to gather feedback on usability and performance.
Create surveys or feedback forms to understand user needs and pain points.
2. Continuous Integration
Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment. Include unit tests, performance benchmarks, and static code analysis.
3. Performance Metrics
Use profiling tools to measure and optimize frame rates, memory usage, and load times.
Benchmark the engine on various hardware configurations to identify bottlenecks.
Would you like me to focus on any specific areas, such as modular design, optimization, or developer tools?
